# Nomai's Sky

A procedurally generated universe of near infinite possibilities!

- Billions of star systems
- You can go to any of them either by warping with the galactic map or by going there with your ship (don't worry, no star will blow up)
- Colorful stars, planet and moons with common to rare (ultra rare?) specificities
- Nothing to interact with yet (or is there?)
- With no added Bramble and anglerfish free*
- Il you have other mods installed you may be able to find them in the stars...  

*Lots of improvements coming soon.*

<sub>\*only in star systems from this mod, not guaranteed in base game</sub>  
<sup><sup><sub>not guaranteed anywhere, mod creator will systematically ignore any reclamation</sub></sup></sup>
