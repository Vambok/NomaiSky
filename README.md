# Nomai's Sky *(beta version)*

A procedurally generated universe of near infinite possibilities!

- Billions of star systems
- You can visit any one of them simply by flying to them (or by warping with the galactic map)
- Colorful stars, planet and moons with common to rare (ultra rare?) specificities
- Nothing to interact with yet <sub>*... or is there?*</sub><!-- *ᵒʳ ˡˢ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ* -->
- No added Bramble, and anglerfish free*
- If you have other mods installed you may be able to find them among the stars...
- You can take your time, no star will blow up *(we finally fixed this damn thing!)*  
  
  
\**only in star systems originating from this mod*  
<sup><sub>*no guarantee given, mod creator will systematically ignore any reclamation*</sub></sup><!--*ⁿᵒ ᵍᵘᵃʳᵃⁿᵗᵉᵉ ᵍˡᵛᵉⁿ ᵃⁿᵈ ᵐᵒᵈ ᶜʳᵉᵃᵗᵒʳ ʷˡˡˡ ˢʸˢᵗᵉᵐᵃᵗˡᶜᵃˡˡʸ ˡᵍⁿᵒʳᵉ ᵃⁿʸ ʳᵉᶜˡᵃᵐᵃᵗˡᵒⁿ*-->
