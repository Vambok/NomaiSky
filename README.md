# Nomai's Sky

A procedurally generated universe of near infinite possibilities!

- Billions of star systems
- You can go to any of them by warping with the galactic map
- Colorful stars, planet and moons with common to rare (ultra rare?) specificities
- Nothing to interact with <sub>(yet! <sub>(or is there?)</sub>)</sub>
- No added Bramble, and anglerfish free*
- If you have other mods installed you may be able to find them among the stars...
(Ps: don't worry, no star will blow up)

<sub>\*only in star systems originating from this mod</sub>  
<sup><sup><sub>no guarantee, mod creator will systematically ignore any reclamation</sub></sup></sup>
